    <h4>Welcome!</h4>
    <p>I created this site to pay homage to a story from the early days of the internet about a user named "TimeTravel_0," or more commonly known as John Titor</p>
    <p>In the years between 1998-2001, Titor made several posts to online forums insisting that he was a time traveler from the year 2036. The contents of these posts ranged from predictions of what would happen in our future, to theories on the existence of multiple worldlines. </p>
    <p>Up to his last post in 2001, he made a number of predictions on what would happen in the near future.</p>
